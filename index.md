# ... a nerd with an MBA

Welcome to my repositiry of papers, articles, and notes exploring how foundational computer science principles translate to competitive advantage in the tech sector, and in general my notes on interesting tech subjects.

Focus areas include:
- Strategic software architecture
- Technical debt as business risk
- Organizational design and Conway's Law
- Platform engineering and developer productivity
- AI/ML system architecture
- Using AI sensibly as a software developer.

## Who is Andrea Cremese?

I am a Staff Software Engineer, working on architectural desgin, coding best practices, organziational arrangmeent, and ... well coding. I have a past across multiple engineering disciplines (material, structural, mechanical), as well as sales engineering, and an MBA. I like many things, I am a NERD with an MBA...
