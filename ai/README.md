# AI for thikning developers

Welcome! This is a quick collection of AI ideas and readings for developers. The field is moving fast—so treat everything here as a snapshot, not gospel.

_Inspired by Melanie Mitchell’s “AI for Thinking Humans.”_

## How I work with AI (as of Feb 2026)

Quick snapshot of my current workflow:

- **VS Code Copilot** is my daily driver (though I'm eyeing Cursor)
- **Role prompts at the outset of a chat**: Start each chat with "assume the role of..." — keeps it focused and cuts down hallucinations (tip from a Google training)
- **Multiple chats**: Different roles, different chats. I have a key combo to swap between them fast
- **Small steps**: Iterate, commit often. Makes it easy to roll back when things go sideways
- **Stack your TODOs**: Keep a running list of concerns the AI surfaces. Explore depth-first. (I'm tempted to build a shared TODO stack across chats)
- **CLIs over MCP**: More flexible, better context. [I wrote about this](mcp%20vs%20terminal%20for%20tool%20calls.html)
- **Share the terminal**: Let the AI see what's happening, as well as interrupt the AI and jump in to run your commands. Context is everything
